    "q1": {
      "question": "What is the cheapest time to travel to Haiti?",
      "answer1": "The most economical time to travel to Haiti is generally between May and October, during the low tourist season. During this period, flight and accommodation rates are often more affordable, and tourist sites are less crowded, allowing for a more peaceful and authentic experience.",
      "answer2": "However, if you prefer a drier and livelier climate, the high season (from December to March) offers ideal sunshine, cultural festivals like the Jacmel Carnival, and a particularly festive atmosphere — but at slightly higher prices."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Where are the best places to stay in Haiti?",
      "answer1": "Looking for a real immersion in Haitian cuisine? Port-au-Prince is home to some of the country's best establishments: La Coquille, La Réserve, Presse Café in Pétion-Ville, Gingerbread in Pacot, or Le Plaza downtown. These restaurants are perfect for discovering the typical flavors of Haiti.",
      "answer2": "For an even more special experience, Le Florville in Kenscoff offers a highly popular Sunday brunch — an excellent way to savor Haitian gastronomy in a relaxed and authentic atmosphere."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Do I need a visa to travel to Haiti?",
      "answer1": "Most visitors do not need a visa to enter Haiti for a tourist stay of less than 90 days. Citizens of many countries, including the United States, Canada, France, Belgium, Switzerland and the majority of Caribbean countries, can enter simply with a valid passport and return ticket.",
      "answer2": "Upon arrival, a small tourist tax may be requested (often included in the plane ticket price).",
      "answer3": "For longer stays or business trips, it is recommended to contact the nearest Haitian embassy or consulate for the most recent information on visa requirements."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Is it safe to travel to Haiti?",
      "answer1": "As in any country, it is important to remain attentive to your surroundings, but Haiti offers a unique and warm experience to those who take the time to discover it. Visitors often find that Haitians are among the most welcoming people in the Caribbean, always ready to share their culture, music and art.",
      "answer2": "Tourist areas like Jacmel, Cap-Haïtien, Kenscoff or Île-à-Vache are particularly appreciated for their tranquility, magnificent beaches and friendly atmosphere. With a little preparation and following local advice, your stay in Haiti will be safe, enriching and unforgettable."
